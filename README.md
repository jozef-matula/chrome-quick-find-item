# chrome-quick-find-item
Google Chrome extensions to quick find item in an HTML select element (drop-down lists and list boxes).

This extension allows you to simply find and select an item in drop-down lists and list boxes which contain lots of items instead of time consuming scrolling through all the items.
You can activate the "Quick find item" function from the context menu by right clicking on the input element. Or simply press `Ctrl+Shift+ArrowDown` when this element has focus. Then start typing the word (sub-string) you are searching for, use `arrow up`/`down` to select if more choices matching your query and press `Return` to finalise your choice.
You can press Escape key to cancel the quick find item mode.
